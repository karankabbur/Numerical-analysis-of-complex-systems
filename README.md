# Numerical-analysis-of-complex-systems
This repository is collection of weekly assignments/projects done for the course of Numerical analysis of complex systems at Scuola Superiore Meridionale(SSM), Napoli, Italy.

The topics of the work is related to Dimnesionality reduction algorithms applied on High dimensional datasets. These algorithms were manually coded in python instead of using already available libraries or functions.

The topics covered for the weekly projects include the following:
1. Regularization
2. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
3. Multi-Dimensional scaling(MDS)
4. kernel-PCA
5. Isomap
6. Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD)

Course supervisor: Prof. Constantinos Siettos
